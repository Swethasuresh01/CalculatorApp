This is a simple Python-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The app takes two numbers and an operator as input and returns the result of the chosen operation.

Features:
  Addition (+)
  Subtraction (-)
  Multiplication (*)
  Division (/)
  Exponentiation (**)

How To Use:
  1. Clone this repository:
       git clone https://github.com/your-username/CalculatorApp.git

  2. Navigate to the project directory:
       cd CalculatorApp

  3. Run the calculator:
       python calculator.py

 4. Enter two numbers and choose an operator from the available options.
      result = my_calculator_app(10, 5, '+')  # Output: 15

Future Improvements:
   Add support for more complex operations (e.g., trigonometry, logarithms).
   Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
